 * A transaction handle, and only that. The per-user advisory lock is transaction-scoped, so on a pool
 * handle each statement may run on a different connection and the lock protects nothing (20 parallel
 * calls got 19 through the limit). Typing these functions with `Tx` makes passing `db()` a type error.
 *
 * Two rules the type can't enforce:
 * - The transaction must run at READ COMMITTED (Postgres's default; don't raise it). The count after the lock
 *   must see rows committed by whoever held the lock first. Under REPEATABLE READ or SERIALIZABLE the snapshot
 *   predates the lock and concurrent callers can all slip under the limit.
 * - Keep the transaction short. The lock serializes this user's attempts and the transaction pins a pooled
 *   connection. Never hold it across a slow call (an AI request, a fetch): consume or reserve in one small
 *   transaction, commit, do the work, and call `releaseRate`/`releaseDaily` in a new transaction if it fails.
